The main driver programs are
  admarAprilFrac.m and 
  admarMayFrac.m for the April and May 2022 datasets from the Collab experiment at SURF.

  These programs use TripletAAMargin.m as the main triplet neural-net with adaptive margins.

The primary data files that are loaded by these programs are contained in the folders CSouMay and CSouRecApril.

Programs for the "pop-rock" experiments are
  popaeC.m, 
  popaeTrip.m and 
  popaeTripCycle.m

  These programs analyze the acoustic emissions in the laboratory test bed.

  These programs are the core programs containing the core algorithms.  There may be additional subfunction dependencies for functions not included in this repository.
